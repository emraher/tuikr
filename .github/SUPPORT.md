# Getting help with tuikr

Before filing an issue, create a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. This makes it easier to diagnose and fix problems. See the [tidyverse help guide](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) for more information.

## Where to ask?

*   **Questions**: Use [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/) or StackOverflow.

*   **Bugs**: [File an issue](https://github.com/emraher/tuikr/issues/new).

*   **Not sure?**: Start with the community forums. Return here if it turns out to be a bug.

[Search existing issues](https://github.com/emraher/tuikr/issues) before opening a new one. The default search is `is:issue is:open`. Remove `is:open` to search all issues, or add `is:pr` or `is:closed` as needed.

## What happens next?

Development tends to happen in bursts when multiple issues accumulate. You may not get an immediate response. A reproducible example is critical - if we can't reproduce the bug, we can't fix it.
